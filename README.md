## Installation
	pip install apiverve-solarpotential

---

## Configuration

Before using the solarpotential API client, you have to setup your account and obtain your API Key.  
You can get it by signing up at [https://apiverve.com](https://apiverve.com)

---

## Usage

The Solar Potential API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/api/solarpotential](https://docs.apiverve.com/api/solarpotential).  
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```
# Import the client module
from apiverve_solarpotential.apiClient import SolarpotentialAPIClient

# Initialize the client with your APIVerve API key
api = SolarpotentialAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")
```

---


### Perform Request
Using the API client, you can perform requests to the API.

###### Define Query

```
query = { "lat": 37.7749,  "lon": -122.4194 }
```

###### Simple Request

```
# Make a request to the API
result = api.execute(query)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

###### Example Response

```
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "coordinates": {
      "latitude": 37.7749,
      "longitude": -122.4194
    },
    "usableHours": {
      "avgDailyUsableSunlightHours": 12.19,
      "yearlyUsableSunlightHoursRaw": 4448,
      "adjustedYearlyUsableSunlightHours": 1557
    },
    "bestDirection": "South",
    "cloudFactor": 0.35,
    "disaclaimer": "This is a rough estimate based on coordinates and general climate patterns. For precise solar potential, consider local weather patterns, obstructions, and professional assessments."
  },
  "code": 200
}
```
